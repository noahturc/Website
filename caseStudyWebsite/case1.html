In this project, I aim to highlight my thought process and proficiency in tools such as Python, pandas, and Tableau, focusing on how I approach each phase of the data analysis development cycle rather than solely presenting the case study itself.

My goal is to create a dynamic dashboard to help people analyze overall bike usage patterns and identify potential seasonal trends. This dashboard will show the impact of weather conditions on bike sharing usage and can be used to make data-driven decisions. Below is a preliminary outline of my dashboard's design.

After viewing the data and metadata I decide to rename the columns to something more significant and simple. I then mapped the floats to the actual values in the columns: "weather" and "season" .

My first visualization is an interactive line chart. This line chart visualizes the 8-week moving average highlighting trends over time. The green-shaded area focuses on a specific period of declining usage, potentially indicating seasonal patterns or other external factors affecting bike share activity.

This dynamic heatmap is designed to show data based on the relationship between temperature (Â°C) and wind speed (KPH) within a specific time frame. The time frame is controlled by a filter linked to the line chart, allowing users to adjust the period of analysis dynamically.
