The following is referring to css and HTML elements in a static website. I want the "about-images" to be the same distance from the right wall as it is from the text-box on the left at all times. If the user zooms in, the text-box tag gets bigger. I want the about-images div to also get bigger but never bigger such that it overlaps the text-box. It is okay if the text-box div overlaps about-images div while the user zooms in. This is the current CSS for the about-images tag: ".about-images { 
    flex: 1; /* Allows the images to take proportional space */
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row; /* Places images side by side */
    flex-wrap: wrap; /* Allows images to wrap to the next row if needed */
    justify-content: center; /* Aligns images in da middle */
    gap: 20px; /* Adds space between images */
    max-width: 100%; /* Ensures the images container doesn't exceed full width */
    overflow: hidden; /* Ensures content doesn't overflow its container */
    box-sizing: border-box; /* Prevents padding from increasing the width */
    top: 0; /* Aligns the container to the top */
    margin-bottom: 90px; /* Keeps some spacing below the paragraph */
    overflow: visible; /* Ensures shadows are not clipped */
}". This is the current CSS for the text-box tag: "  .text-box {
    background-color: #adcaf1;
    border-radius: 15px; /* Rounded edges */
    padding: 20px; /* Adds spacing inside the box */
    box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);
    width: 820px; /* Limits the width of the box to 50% of the screen */
  }". Tell me the necessary changes to the CSS to achieve this.























Newest and best css:


.text-box {
    background-color: #adcaf1;
    border-radius: 15px;
    padding: 20px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);
    
    /* Never let the text box exceed 75% of the container width */
    flex: 0 1 75%;
    max-width: 100%;  
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin: 0;               /* No extra left/right margins */
  }



 .about-images {
    /* Switch to a two-column layout that flows each image independently */
    column-count: 2;
    column-gap: 20px;
    
    /* Keep the original constraints to sit beside the text box */
    flex: 0 1 25%;
    max-width: 25%;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin-bottom: 90px;
  }
