        <h1>Cover Letter Generator</h1>
        <p>An AI cover letter generator built with Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that creates personalized cover letters based on a userâ€™s resume and job description. This project served as a valuable exploration into AI integration and web development. The development process provided hands-on experience with integrating AI into a full-stack application, enhancing my understanding of both backend logic and frontend design.</p>

        <h1>Image Recognition Model</h1>
        <p>A machine learning model designed to identify car models from images and retrieve detailed specifications and related information. While the model's accuracy is limited, due to being trained on a small dataset of approximately 500 images, the development process was an invaluable learning experience. This project provided me with deep insights into neural networks, PyTorch, and key machine learning concepts.</p>

        <h1>This Website</h1>
        <p>I developed this website using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Flask, and deployed it on AWS. This project highlights my technical skills and ability to integrate diverse technologies. Throughout the process, I encountered and resolved numerous challenges, including deploying the site on an AWS EC2 instance with a Flask backend. I underestimated the number of challenges and errors that would arise, but through perseverance and plenty of headaches, I successfully got it up and running.</p>

        <h1>Python Playground</h1>
        <p>My Python Playground is a collection of Python functions and coding challenges inspired by platforms like Edabit. While this isn't really a project and more something I do for fun (more so when I was first getting started), it represents my enthusiasm for coding and my ongoing journey to sharpen my programming skills and problem solving.</p>
