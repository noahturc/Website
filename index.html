          <h2 class="paragraph-title">My Areas of Expertise</h2>
          <p>I am fluent in Python and SQL, using them extensively for data analysis, engineering, and problem-solving. I also have working knowledge of R, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PowerShell. In addition to programming, I have hands-on experience with data cleaning and preprocessing, building ETL pipelines, and working with machine learning models, including regression, classification, and clustering. I am also familiar with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text analysis. For data visualization, I leverage tools like Tableau and Python libraries such as Matplotlib to create insightful dashboards and visualizations. I have experience with Flask for developing lightweight web applications and am comfortable working with the Linux command line for scripting and automation. My understanding of core software engineering concepts—including databases, source control, operating systems, and artificial intelligence—positions me well for roles involving data or software development.</p>
    
          <h2 class="paragraph-title">My Technical Journey</h2>
          <p>My passion for technology began in high school when I discovered Kaggle.com. I immersed myself in the platform, completing various courses such as Introduction to Programming, Python, Pandas, and Intro to Machine Learning. During school breaks and lunches, I would write code in Kaggle’s online Jupyter Notebook environment, unaware of the world of IDEs at the time. The moment I discovered IDEs, my learning accelerated. I dived into object-oriented programming, neural networks, web scraping, web development languages, and various Python frameworks. Online courses and tutorials broadened my knowledge, introducing me to operating systems, networking, source control, and databases. My journey also included a C++ class where I learned low-level programming concepts. Most recently, using Google’s data analytics course along with my SQL and Python skills, I learned how to clean and analyze raw data to create meaningful dashboards. This journey represents just the beginning, as I continually seek new opportunities to expand my skills and explore the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>

          <h2 class="paragraph-title">My Hobbies</h2>
          <p>Outside of technology, I enjoy staying active and spending time outdoors. Playing basketball is what keeps me in shape and it’s my go-to sport. If I ever take a break from coding, I might just try out for the NBA. In colder months, I go snowboarding, nothing beats cruising down a good slope. As I grow older and develop a deeper appreciation for God’s creation, I’ve discovered that hiking offers a chance to slow down, connect with nature, and recharge. Indoors, my curiosity and love for technology drive my ability to independently learn and explore new concepts. I stay engaged because I truly enjoy this field—unlike biology, where I learned that dissecting pigs was not my passion. These activities keep me energized and ready for whatever challenges come next, whether on the court, the slopes, or at my desk.</p>
